## Week two challenge- Create a portfolio

This webpage was created by scratch to apply everything I learned about HTML and CSS. I the fundamentals of how to build a webpage using HTML. I learned about attributes and how they can be used to control an element's behavior. I learned the parent/child hierarchy and how to nest elements within other elements. 

I also learned about CSS and how you can use attribues such as id and class with css to style elements. I also learned about pseudo-class selectors, like "hover:". I also learned about the CSS Box Model so that I could design my layout for this webpage. I used properties such as padding, margin, and border, to give the page some style. I also dove into flexbox and was able to play around with different properties, as well as apply that to media queries so that the wepage is responsive amoung different devices. I'm looking forward to seeing the improvement as I learn more skills. Thank you!
